Second course assignment on triangle meshes 
We implement a data structure to represent a triangle mesh, and use it to perform some basic mesh processing tasks. We can interactively visualize the mesh in 3D, given its vertex data and triangle indices. We work with the mesh data structure itself to create and modify meshes.
